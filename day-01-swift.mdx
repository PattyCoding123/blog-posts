I am currently attempting a challenge with my friend to learn SwiftUI in 100 days. To do so, I am following
an amazing guide from [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

Day 1 is all about learning how to create variables, constants, strings, and numbers.

## **Variables**

Variables can be created with the **_var_** keyword:

```swift
var myName = "Patrick" // myName is a string
myName="Hello" // Valid
```

Variables can have their values reassigned.

## **Constants**

Constants can be created with the **_let_** keyword:

```swift
let myMajor = "Computer Science" // myMajor is a string
```

Unlike variables, constants **CANNOT** be reassigned. So, doing something like:

```swift
let myMajor = "Computer Science"
myMajor = "Biology" // ERROR
```

would not be allowed in Swift.

## **Strings**

Strings are variables/constants that are assigned to text. Text must always be in double quotes. If you want to use a double quote inside the string, escape them with a backslash \:

```swift
let myStr = "A valid \"string\" is here" // Valid
```

To create a multi-line string, you must use triple quotes in which they start and end on their own line:

```swift
let myWordyStr = """
This is my string.
It's on multiple lines.
"""
```

## **Numbers**

In Swift, the two main types of numbers are integers and decimals (referred to as "Doubles").

- **_Integers_** are any whole number. Swift has a way to allow you to separate digits without causing a syntax error:

```swift
let myBigNumber = 100_000_000 // Valid integer, treated as 100000000
```

- **_Doubles_** are any numbers with a decimal point:

```swift
let pie = 3.14159 // Valid double
```

Until now, I have never
seen a language where you could **NOT** perform mathematical
operations between integers and doubles, until I met Swift.

```swift
let myInt = 1
let myDouble = 1.0
let mySum = myInt + myDouble // ERROR
```

You must cast either:

```swift
let myInt = 1
let myDouble = 1.0
let mySum = Double(myInt) + myDouble
```

OR

```swift
let myInt = 1
let myDouble = 1.0
let mySum = myInt + Int(myDouble)
```

## **Finally**

Here are some of the other things I learned:

- print() will print values to the terminal
- // is a comment, /\* \*/ are multiline comments
- Operators such as +, - , \* , and / are available to both integers and doubles
- Compound assignment operators are valid for integers and
  doubles
- Swift is type safe! (Very happy about this)
