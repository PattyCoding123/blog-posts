Great news, I am finished with Day 5 of the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

Day 5 was a little lengthy as we covered many of the ways we check conditional statements in Swift!

## **The if statement**

The if statement is a foundational part of any high level programming language, and it is no different in Swift.
The simple if statement looks like this:

```swift

if someCondition {
  print("Do some stuff")
}

```

As you can see, the if statement is very straightforward and there are three components:

- The keyword **_if_**
- The condition itself
- The curly braces which signify the block of code that must be executed if the condition is true

Furthermore, there are six comparison operators in Swift:

- \> (greater than)
- < (less than)
- \>= (greater than or equal to)
- <= (less than or equal to)
- == (equal to)
- != (not equal to)

It is important to note that comparing two variables/constants that are of different types is invalid in Swift:

```swift

let myScore: Double = 89.8
let highestScore: Int = 95

// Invalid, since myScore and highestScore are different types
if myScore >= highestScore {

}

```

Finally, when it comes to data types with length such as Strings, Arrays, Dictionaries, and Sets, we can check whether they are empty using the **isEmpty** attribute instead of checking if **count == 0**. This is because using **count** is expensive in Swift since it will go through and manually count each item.

```swift

let username: String = "MyUsername"
if username.isEmpty {
  // Do something
}

```

## **else, else if, &&, and ||**

For checking multiple conditions, Swift supports the **else** and **else if** conditional keywords:

```swift
let score = 85

if score > 89 {
  print("You got an A")
} else if score > 79 {
  print("You got a B")
} else {
  print("Your grade is not eligible for the Honor Roll")
}


```

To compare two conditions at once, we can use the compound conditional operators && and ||.

```swift

// We can use parentheses to indicate which compound
// conditionals should be evaluated.
if (isAuthed && isOwner) || isAdmin {

}

```

While parentheses are not necessarily needed, they do help in maintaining the readability of your code.

## **Switch Statements**

Switch statements allow us to efficiently check multiple conditions in our Swift code. Here is an example of how to use a switch statement:

```swift

enum Weather {
  case sunny
  case cloudy
  case rainy
}

let today = Weather.cloudy

// Notice that the code we want to run for each case is indented.
switch today {
  case .sunny:
    print("It is sunny")
  case .cloudy:
    print("It is cloudy")
  case .rainy:
    print("it is rainy")
}


```

In Swift, the switch statement must be **exhaustive**, meaning that every single condition must be covered. In the example above, we covered each possible case for the enum. However, if we were comparing something like an integer or a string, we would need to provide a default case.

```swift

let number = 6

switch number {
  case 5:
    // Do something
  case 4:
    // Do stuff
  case 3:
    // Do more
  default:
    /* If we don't hit the other cases, run this block
    of code. */
}


```

Finally, for switch statements, if we wanted cases to keep executing from one case downwards, we would use the **fallthrough** keyword:

```swift

let number = 6

switch number {
  case 5:
    // Do something
    fallthrough
  case 4:
    // Do stuff
    fallthrough
  case 3:
    // Do more
    fallthrough
  default:
    /* If we don't hit the other cases, run this block
    of code. */
}


```

In the example above, if case 5 were to execute, then all the code in case 4, case 3, and the default would execute as well.

In general, I don't really use switch statements that much within my own code, but I would definitely use it if my code started to look a little unreadable.

## **Ternary Conditional Operator**

Finally, we get to one of my favorite operators to use which is the ternary conditional operator. Swift's version is basically the same as in all the languages I have used it in before such as TypeScript. A simple usage looks like this:

```swift

let canDrink = age >= 21 ? "Yes" : "No"

```

The example above assigns canDrink either "Yes" if age is greater than or equal to than 21, and "No" otherwise. While it seems more difficult to understand than using a simple if/else statement, it is sometimes the only thing you can do!

For instance, I have experience working with React, and the ternary conditional operator is incredibly useful when doing conditional rendering. I suspect it will be the same in SwiftUI if we need to conditionally render some UI in our app.
