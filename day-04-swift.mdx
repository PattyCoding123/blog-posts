Day 4 of the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) has been completed.
I am incredibly happy of the progress I am making so far!

Day 4 was pretty short, just a coverage on Type Annotations and Checkpoint 2.

## **Type Annotations**

Type Annotations allow us to explicitly declare the type a variable or a constant should be during runtime.
This is incredibly helpful, especially if we cannot infer a type by assigning a value to a variable/constant right away.
The following code will showcase all the most common types we will use:

```swift

var names: String // names is of type String

var someCount: Int // someCount is of type Int

var money: Double // money is of type Double

var truth: Bool // truth is of type Bool (Boolean)

var words: [String] // words is an Array of Strings

var associates: [String:Double] /* associates is a dictionary with String keys and Double values */

var quick: Set<String> // quick is a Set which contains Strings
```

It is also good to note that with type annotations, this allows us to assign a value to a constant later while still keeping it type safe.

```swift

let name: String // The constant is of type String
name = "Patrick" // Valid Swift

```

It is mainly up to preference whether someone wants to use type inferencing vs explicitly declaring the type of a variable/constant. Personally, I like explicitly declaring my types.

## **Checkpoint 2**

In Checkpoint 2, we were tasked to:

- Create an array of Strings
- Print the number of items in the array
- Print the number of unique items in the array

Here is my code:

```swift

// Checkpoint 2
let randomArray: [String] = ["Hello", "Goodbye", "Hello", "Computers", "Patrick", "Computers"]
let randomSet: Set<String> = Set(randomArray)

print("Number of items in the array: \(randomArray.count)")
print("Number of unique items in the array: \(randomSet.count)")

```
