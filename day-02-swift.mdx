Happy to say I finished Day 2 of the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

Day 2 was all abut learning Booleans, String Concatenation,
and String Interpolation. I also completed checkpoint 1!

## **Booleans**

Like in many programming languages, a boolean constant or variable can be declared using either the values **_true_** or **_false_**:

```swift

let myTrueBoolean = true

let myFalseBoolean = false

```

Boolean variables can even be initialized by a function that
returns a boolean value.

```swift

let myNum = 120
let isMulti = myNum.isMultiple(of: 3) // Assigned as true

```

Additionally, a boolean variable can be negated (flipped) through either the **not** operator ( **!** ) or the **toggle()** method:

```swift

var myBoolean = false
myBoolean = !myBoolean // myBoolean is now true
myBoolean.toggle() // myBoolean is now false again

```

## **String Concatenation**

In Swift, we can concatenate strings easily using the **+** overloaded operator.

```swift

let myMajor = "Computer Science" // myMajor is a string
let myString = "My major is " + myMajor
print(myString)
// My major is Computer Science

```

It should be noted however that we cannot add other data types to strings through **+**. To do so, we would need to cast the value to a string. For instance:

```swift

let myNumber = 10
let myString = "I want to print the number " + myNumber // NOT ALLOWED

let correct = "I want to print the number " + String(myNumber) // ALLOWED

```

## **String Interpolation**

In Swift, to inject variables or constants inside a string during runtime, we can use the \\( ) inside a string.

```swift

let charCount = 7
let myName = "Patrick"
let myMessage = "My first name, \(myName), has \(charCount) letters!"
print(myMessage)
// My first name, Patrick, has 7 letters!

```

## **Checkpoint 1**

For checkpoint 1, we were tasked to create a Swift playground that:

- Creates a constant holding any temperature in Celsius.
- Converts it to Fahrenheit by multiplying by 9, dividing by 5, then adding 32.
- Prints the result for the user, showing both the Celsius and Fahrenheit values.

Here is my finished code:

```swift

// Checkpoint 1
let celsiusTemp = 100
let fahrenheit = ((celsiusTemp * 9) / 5) + 32
print("Celsius = \(celsiusTemp) 째C, Fahrenheit = \(fahrenheit) 째F")
// Celsius = 100 째C, Fahrenheit = 212 째F

```

I am looking forward to the upcoming challenges!
